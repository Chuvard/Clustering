# Clustering

### Project's Title: Clustering


### Project Description (Problem Statement): 
- We will implement the K-means algorithm and use it for image compression.

- We will start with a sample dataset that will help you gain an intuition of how the K-means algorithm works.
- After that, we will use the K-means algorithm for image compression by reducing the number of colors that occur in an image to only those that are most common in that image.

### How to Install and Run the Project:

To successfully run this project you have to do the following steps:

	Step 1. Run the "Clustering" Jupyter Notebook file on your PC/Notebook.

	Step 2. Import all required libraries and data frames from the Section "Importing modules".

	Step 3. Import the dataset. Run the cell of the "Dataset" Section for the corresponding part of a project to get the previously mentioned project goals due to the Clustering model execution.

	Step 4. Run each cell with Python code within the Jupyter Notebook file sequentially following the instructions. Moreover, get familiar with a theoretical background and comprehensive interpretations of the employed Machine Learning Model to execute the goals of the underlying problem statement.
